About

I'm a Web Developer based out of Phoenix, AZ, with a strong background in marketing, business development, and project management.
This allows me to understand business and organizational needs from a different perspective and makes collaboration effortless between UX/UI.
I pride myself on being able to effectively address challenges in both English and "Tech" for people in the organization that are less technically inclined.
I also wake up every day and make an effort to learn something new. I know I don't know everything, and I'm comfortable with that.
I'm also comfortable with how resourceful I am, and how half the battle sometimes is choosing the RIGHT battle to have.

Skills

HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, BootStrap4, AJAX, XML, npm, Git
Familiar w/ JS Frameworks: Vue.js, React


Current Works

I'm very interested in how cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are revolutionizing different industries.
So I'm currently working with companies in this space. I won't bore with too many details, but you can find a semi-functional
dashboard prototype we're in the process of setting up for investors to offer loans via crypto or fiat currency to start-ups via a private investment network.
